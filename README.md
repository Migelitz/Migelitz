# 👋 **Hello there!** _I'm Chyrus Miguel D. Macalla_

Welcome to my GitHub corner! I'm an aspiring computer science student and a passionate **Python programmer** currently expanding my skills in **C++** and **Java**. I enjoy solving problems through logical coding and am excited about diving deeper into software engineering principles.

## 🎮 **Current Projects**

I have developed several projects including a Hangman game, a Slot Machine simulation, and a simple Banking system. I am currently exploring new projects in game development and software applications.

## 📚 **Learning Goals**

- **Programming Languages & Libraries:** Strengthening my knowledge in Python, C++, and Java, and working with libraries like PyQt5, pygame, and core Python modules such as sys, time, datetime, and random.
- **Data Science & AI:** Beginning to explore artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques.
- **Software Engineering:** Focusing on writing clean, logical, and maintainable code, embracing software engineering principles including problem-solving, best practices, and testing.
- **Continuous Learning:** Developing a mindset of curiosity and persistence in mastering new skills and technologies.

## 🤝 **Collaboration Interests**

I’m eager to collaborate on projects involving Python, software development, AI, or anything that challenges my problem-solving skills. If you have ideas or opportunities to share, let’s connect!

## 🆘 **Seeking Help**

As I continue my journey into computer science and programming, I welcome advice, mentorship, and feedback from experienced developers and peers.
