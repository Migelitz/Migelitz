<h2>🎮 <b>Fun Facts</b></h2>

I’m a huge fan of video games, webtoons, manga, and anime (especially... Ehem). While Python is my main squeeze, I dabble in other programming languages too. Additionally, I hate arts!💢 I'm not creative nor passionate about it😤. Like damn... I suck at it. Lastly, I often find myself spiraling down internet rabbit holes, gaining random bits of knowledge along the way!
